# Repository-specific configuration

You can add a configuration file named either `.scala-steward.conf` or `scala-steward.conf` to configure how Scala Steward updates your repository.
The `[.]scala-steward.conf` configuration file can be located in the root of your repository, in `.github` directory or in `.config` directory (searched in this order).
If a configuration file exists in more than one location, only the first found file is taken into account.

```properties
# pullRequests.frequency allows to control how often or when Scala Steward
# is allowed to create pull requests.
#
# Possible values:
#   @asap
#     PRs are created without delay.
#
#   <timespan>
#     PRs are created only again after the given timespan since the last PR
#     has passed. Example values are "36 hours", "1 day", or "14 days".

#   <CRON expression>
#     PRs are created roughly according to the given CRON expression.
#
#     CRON expressions consist of five fields:
#     minutes, hour of day, day of month, month, and day of week.
#
#     See https://www.alonsodomin.me/cron4s/userguide/index.html#parsing for
#     more information about the CRON expressions that are supported.
#
#     Note that the date parts of the CRON expression are matched exactly
#     while the time parts are only used to abide to the frequency of
#     the given expression.
#
# Default: "@asap"
#
#pullRequests.frequency = "0 0 ? * 3" # every thursday on midnight
pullRequests.frequency = "7 days"

# pullRequests.grouping allows you to specify how Scala Steward should group
# your updates in order to reduce the number of pull-requests.
#
# Updates will be placed in the first group with which they match, starting
# from the first in the array. Those that do not match any group will follow
# the default procedure (one PR per update).
#
# Each element in the array will have the following schema:
#
#   - name (mandatory): the name of the group, will be used for things like naming the branch
#   - title (optional): if provided it will be used as the title for the PR
#   - filter (mandatory): a non-empty list containing the filters to use to know
#                         if an update falls into this group.
#
# `filter` properties would have this format:
#
#    {
#       version = "major" | "minor" | "patch" | "pre-release" | "build-metadata",
#       group = "{group}",
#       artifact = "{artifact}"
#    }
#
# For more information on the values for the `version` filter visit https://semver.org/
#
# Every field in a `filter` is optional but at least one must be provided.
#
# For grouping every update together a filter like {group = "*"} can be # provided.
#
# To create a new PR for each unique combination of artifact-versions, include ${hash} in the name.
#
# Default: []
pullRequests.grouping = [

# pullRequests.includeMatchedLabels allows to control which autogenerated labels are added to PRs

commits.message = "Update ${artifactName} from ${currentVersion} to ${nextVersion}"

# If true and when upgrading version in .scalafmt.conf, Scala Steward will perform scalafmt

# Assign people from the list to the pull request or request a review.
# Currently supported only for GitLab and GitHub.
# GitLab users - free version of GitLab only supports one assignee and one reviewer, others will be ignored.
# GitHub users - to request review from a team inside your organisation it should be specified
# like "yourOrg/yourTeam" in `reviewers` config below.
# Please note that only accounts with write access to the repository (Developer role for GitLab) are able
# to add assignees or request reviews. Consequently, it won't work for public @scala-steward instance on GitHub.

```

The version information given in the patterns above can be in two formats:
1. just a `version` field that is treated as a prefix of the version
2. a structure consisting of any of the following fields:
   * `prefix`: is matched against the beginning of the version
   * `suffix`: is matched against the end of the version
   * `exact`: is matched against the whole version
   * `contains`: is matched against substrings in the version

```properties
version = "1.1."
version = { prefix = "1.1." }
version = { suffix = "jre8" }
version = { prefix = "1.1.", suffix = "jre8" }
version = { exact = "1.1.2.jre8" }
version = { contains = "feature" }
```

## Ignore lines

Though `updates.ignores` offers granular configuration to exclude dependencies from update, Scala Steward also recognizes markers in file to ignore lines.

Dependencies in lines between `// scala-steward:off` and `// scala-steward:on` are not updated.

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  // scala-steward:off
  "com.github.pathikrit" %% "better-files" % "3.8.0",
  "com.olegpy" %% "better-monadic-for" % "0.3.1",
  // scala-steward:on
  "org.typelevel" %% "cats-effect" % "1.3.1",  // This and subsequent will get updated
  "org.typelevel" %% "cats-kernel-laws" % "1.6.1"
)
```

Also, the line ends with `// scala-steward:off` is not updated solely.

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-actor" % "2.4.0", // scala-steward:off
  "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-testkit" % "2.5.0", // This and subsequent will get updated
)
```
